# AI Agent Instructions - Project Template

## About This Template

This is a PROJECT TEMPLATE for AI-driven coding and project management workflows. It establishes baseline
restrictions, patterns, and subagent architectures that ensure safe and effective AI assistance.

**Directory Structure:**

- `.claude/agents/` - Specialized subagents (auto-registered by Claude Code)
- `.claude/commands/` - Slash commands and workflows (auto-registered by Claude Code)
- `.claude/scripts/` - Utility scripts including `available-agents.sh` to list agents

**For Project Maintainers:** Extend this file with project-specific sections:

- Project description and goals
- Technology stack and dependencies
- Development setup instructions
- Testing and deployment guidelines
- Project-specific code patterns and conventions

## CRITICAL: Git State Modification Restrictions

### ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED

AI agents working in this repository are **NOT AUTHORIZED** to make any changes to git state. The following
operations are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**:

#### Staging Operations

- **NO** `git add` commands (including `git add .`, `git add -A`, `git add <file>`)
- **NO** `git rm` or `git mv` commands
- **NO** staging of any files through any mechanism

#### Commit Operations

- **NO** `git commit` commands (including `git commit -m`, `git commit --amend`)
- **NO** creating, modifying, or amending commits
- **NO** commit message generation that results in actual commits

#### Index and Working Tree Modifications

- **NO** `git reset` commands (soft, mixed, or hard)
- **NO** `git restore` or `git checkout` that modifies files
- **NO** `git clean` commands
- **NO** `git stash` operations that modify the working tree

#### Remote Repository Operations (EXTREMELY DANGEROUS)

**[CRITICAL WARNING]**: Remote operations affect shared resources and can impact other team members' work!

- **NO** `git push` commands - **ALL FORMS PROHIBITED**:
  - **NO** `git push` (standard push)
  - **NO** `git push --force` or `git push -f` (force push)

- **NO** branch creation, deletion, or switching that affects working tree
- **NO** tag creation or deletion

#### Configuration Changes

- **NO** modifications to `.git/config` or global git configuration
- **NO** changes to `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, or other git metadata files through git commands

### PERMITTED READ-ONLY OPERATIONS

AI agents **MAY** use the following git commands for information gathering:

#### Status and Information

- `git status` - View current repository state
- `git diff` - View uncommitted changes
- `git diff --staged` - View staged changes
- `git diff <commit> <commit>` - Compare commits

#### History and Inspection

- `git log` - View commit history
- `git show` - Display commit details
- `git blame` - View line-by-line authorship
- `git reflog` - View reference logs

#### Branch Information

- `git branch` - List branches
- `git branch -r` - List remote branches
- `git branch -a` - List all branches

#### Remote Information

- `git remote -v` - View remote repositories
- `git fetch --dry-run` - Check for updates without fetching

#### File and Tree Inspection

- `git ls-files` - List tracked files
- `git ls-tree` - List tree objects
- `git cat-file` - Display repository objects

## EXCEPTION 1: WORKFLOW EXCEPTION

### Automated Workflow Commands

There is **ONE SPECIFIC EXCEPTION** to the above restrictions:

**Workflows defined in `.claude/commands/` directory MAY manipulate git state, but ONLY:**

1. **When executing the EXACT instructions** specified in those workflow files
2. **Without ANY deviation** from the documented procedures
3. **In the specific context** of those automated workflows
4. **With explicit user approval** where required by the workflow

#### Currently Authorized Workflows

The following workflows have special git operation permissions:

- **`/commit` workflow** (`.claude/commands/commit.md`)
  - MAY create commits after validation and user approval
  - MAY use `git stash` temporarily during validation
  - MUST follow the exact procedure documented in the workflow file

- **`/check` workflow** (`.claude/commands/check.md`)
  - Remains READ-ONLY
  - May examine git state but makes no modifications
  - Generates reports without altering repository

### Workflow Execution Rules

When executing authorized workflows:

1. **Follow the documented procedure EXACTLY** - no improvisation
2. **Respect all safety checks** built into the workflow
3. **Obtain user approval** at designated checkpoints
4. **Report failures** without attempting unauthorized fixes
5. **Never extend permissions** beyond what's explicitly documented

## EXCEPTION 2: EXPLICIT USER INSTRUCTIONS

### Interactive Session Git Operations

There is a **SECOND SPECIFIC EXCEPTION** for direct user instructions in interactive/chat sessions:

**When users provide CLEAR, EXPLICIT instructions for git operations:**

#### CRITICAL: Guidelines Override Everything

**THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE**: When performing git operations under this exception, you MUST IMMEDIATELY AND
COMPLETELY read any relevant guidelines (e.g., `.claude/guidelines/git.md` for commits). This is not optional—it
is an ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT that supersedes ALL other instructions.

**GUIDELINES ARE LAW**: Project guidelines for git operations are MANDATORY, IMMUTABLE, and SACRED. They are not:

- Optional or flexible
- Subject to interpretation
- Able to be shortened, skipped, or approximated
- Overrideable by ANY other instruction, request, or context

Even when users explicitly request git operations to be done in a specific way, the project's git guidelines MUST
be followed exactly.

**When Guidelines Conflict with User Requests**: If a user's explicit request cannot be executed in compliance
with the project's git guidelines, you MUST:

1. **Refuse** to perform the operation
2. **Explain** specifically which guideline prevents the requested action
3. **Suggest** the exact manual commands the user can run themselves if they choose to override the guidelines

#### Requirements for This Exception

1. **User intent MUST be crystal clear and unambiguous**
   - Explicit commands like "commit these changes" or "stage all modified files"
   - No interpretation or inference of intent allowed
   - If ANY ambiguity exists, clarification MUST be requested

2. **Verification and Delegation Protocol**

   The agent MUST follow this exact sequence:

   a. **FIRST: Verify user intent is explicit**
      - The instruction must be unambiguous
      - No guessing or inferring what the user "probably" wants

   b. **SECOND: Check for matching slash commands**
      - Check the "Available Slash Commands" section in this document
      - If a matching command exists, SUGGEST it to the user with a filled-in directive
      - The directive should be precise, convey clear intent, and remain on one line
      - Example: `/commit Fix navigation dropdown not closing on mobile devices`
      - Present the exact command the user can copy and execute
      - Explain what the command will do and why it's appropriate
      - Let the USER execute the command, maintaining their control over operations

   c. **THIRD: Check for appropriate subagents (if no slash command matches)**
      - Check your internal registry for available subagents (automatically registered from `.claude/agents/`)
      - To see available agents, you can also run: `.claude/scripts/available-agents.sh`
      - Identify if a subagent handles this specific operation
      - If an appropriate subagent exists, DELEGATE to them
      - These subagents have domain-specific expertise and know project conventions

   d. **FOURTH: Execute directly ONLY if no slash command or subagent exists**
      - **Efficiency principle**: Compare the total effort of delegation (preparing context, invoking agent,
        reviewing output) against direct execution
      - If delegation overhead exceeds the task complexity, execute directly
      - Direct execution is appropriate for simple, atomic tasks that are unlikely to require extensive debugging
      - For complex or multi-step tasks: Use the general-purpose agent (Opus for complex reasoning, Sonnet for
        standard tasks)
      - EXCEPTION: Always delegate critical tasks to specialists regardless of complexity. This includes, but is
        not limited to:
         - Security-related tasks
         - Agent self-modification
      - No additions, no improvements, no "helpful extras"
      - Report exactly what was done

3. **Risk Acknowledgment**

   **CRITICAL**: Treat ANY git state change as potentially destructive:
   - Always confirm with user before execution
   - Clearly state what will be modified
   - Suggest running `git status` or `git diff` first if appropriate
   - Never proceed with ambiguous instructions

#### Examples of Valid Explicit Instructions

**ACCEPTABLE (clear and explicit):**

- "Stage the typo fix in README.md"
- "Stage all changes related to the authentication fix"
- "Cherry-pick commit a1b2c3d4 from the main branch"

**NOT ACCEPTABLE (requires clarification):**

- "Commit the staged changes" (should suggest /commit command instead)
- "Clean this up" (ambiguous - what needs cleaning?)
- "Handle the git stuff" (too vague)
- "Commit my work" (which files? what message?)
- "Stage README.md" (may include unintended changes - need to specify which changes)
- "Add all Python files" (too broad - specify which changes/features to stage)

#### Examples: Priority-Based Delegation Hierarchy

##### Example 1: Slash Command Available (Highest Priority)

**User Request**: "I've finished making changes to the authentication system. Can you commit them with a good
message?"

**CORRECT Response** (suggesting slash command):

```text
I see you want to commit your authentication system changes. I can suggest the appropriate slash command for this:

**Suggested command:**
`/commit Authentication system improvements`

**What this will do:**
1. Check that you have staged changes ready
2. Run validation on your code
3. Generate a proper commit message based on your changes
4. Ask for your approval before creating the commit

**Rationale:** The `/commit` workflow handles git operations safely with built-in validation and user approval
steps. More importantly, the workflow is complex and performing all its steps would poison the context of the
current session, causing the agent to lose track of the original work. Using the slash command keeps the context
fresh while delegating the complex operation to a specialized workflow.

By running this command yourself, you also maintain full control over what gets committed. The workflow will
automatically stage the appropriate changes based on your description - you don't need to manually stage files
first.
```

##### Example 2: Subagent Available (Second Priority)

**User Request**: "Can you analyze the performance of my database queries and suggest optimizations?"

**CORRECT Response** (delegating to subagent):

```text
I'll delegate this to our database performance specialist subagent who has expertise in query optimization.

[Delegating to database performance subagent in .claude/agents/db-performance.md]

The specialist will:
1. Analyze your current query patterns
2. Identify performance bottlenecks
3. Suggest specific optimizations
4. Provide implementation guidance
```

##### Example 3: No Slash Command or Subagent (Third Priority)

**User Request**: "Can you fix the indentation in config.json?"

**CORRECT Response** (direct execution):

```text
I'll fix the indentation in config.json directly since this is a simple formatting task.

[Reading and editing the file with proper JSON formatting]

Done! I've corrected the indentation in config.json to use consistent 2-space indentation.
```

**INCORRECT Responses** (breaking the hierarchy):

```text
# Wrong: Trying to execute a slash command instead of suggesting it
I'll run the /commit command for you...
[Attempting to execute directly]

# Wrong: Direct execution when a slash command exists
I'll create the commit directly with git...
[Ignoring available slash command]

# Wrong: Direct execution when a subagent exists
I'll analyze your database queries myself...
[Ignoring specialized subagent]
```

**Why this hierarchy works:**

- Slash commands give users maximum control while preventing context poisoning from complex workflows
- Slash commands handle staging automatically based on user descriptions, avoiding unintended changes
- Subagents provide specialized expertise for complex domains
- Direct execution handles simple tasks efficiently without delegation overhead
- The general-purpose agent handles complex multi-step tasks when no specialized tool exists
- Clear priority order prevents confusion and ensures appropriate handling

#### Execution Rules Under This Exception

When this exception applies:

1. **Confirm understanding** of the exact operation requested
2. **Check for workflows** that handle this operation better
3. **Warn about risks** if operation is destructive
4. **Execute precisely** what was requested - nothing more
5. **Report results** clearly and completely

#### Safe Staging Method When Explicitly Requested

When a user explicitly requests staging specific changes (and no slash command exists):

**ALWAYS use `git apply --cached` with LLM-generated diffs:**

```bash
# Generate the exact diff from changes discussed with user
# For line edits: include context lines read from the actual file
cat <<'EOF' | git apply --cached
diff --git a/file.rs b/file.rs
index abc123..def456 100644
--- a/file.rs
+++ b/file.rs
@@ -10,5 +10,5 @@
 context line before (from file)
-old line being replaced (from file)
+new line replacing it (your change)
 context line after (from file)
EOF

# Verify what was staged
git diff --cached
```

**NOTE**: Always spot check the git index after applying the diff to ensure it was correctly applied. Use
`git diff --cached` to review the actual staged changes and verify they match what you intended. If the diff
didn't apply cleanly, you may need to use `git diff HEAD -- file.rs` to see the original state of the file
(before any changes) and regenerate your diff from that baseline.

**NEVER use `git add` directly** - even when explicitly requested. The `git apply --cached` method provides
precise control and ensures only the specific changes discussed are staged.

#### This Exception Does NOT Apply To

- Vague or ambiguous requests
- Inferred intentions
- "Helpful" additions beyond what was requested
- Automated or scheduled operations
- Operations where user intent is unclear

## Violation Consequences

Any attempt to violate these rules should result in:

1. **Immediate operation termination**
2. **Clear error message** explaining the restriction
3. **Suggestion of permitted alternatives** (if applicable)
4. **No further processing** until user provides explicit override

## Rationale

These restrictions exist to:

- **Preserve user control** over repository state
- **Prevent accidental data loss** or corruption
- **Maintain clear audit trail** of all changes
- **Ensure predictable agent behavior**
- **Protect against unintended commits** or modifications

## Implementation Notes

### For AI Agents

When a user requests a git state change:

1. **Check if the operation is in an authorized workflow**
2. **If NOT authorized**: Politely refuse and explain the restriction
3. **If authorized**: Follow the workflow procedure exactly
4. **Always prioritize safety** over task completion

### Example Responses

#### When asked to commit changes directly

```text
I cannot directly execute git commit commands. This operation is restricted to maintain repository safety.

**Suggested command you can run:**
`/commit [Description of your changes]`

This will handle validation and generate an appropriate commit message for your approval.

Alternatively, you can manually run: git commit -m "your message"
```

#### When asked to stage files

```text
I cannot execute git add commands directly as this would modify the repository state.

You can stage files yourself using:
- git add <specific-file> for individual files
- git add -p for interactive staging

Or use the authorized workflows in .claude/commands/ if applicable.
```

#### When asked to review or check code

```text
I can analyze your code for issues.

**Suggested command you can run:**
`/check [scope]`

This will perform comprehensive validation including syntax, style, security, and best practices.

Example: `/check staged` to check only staged changes
```

## Security Considerations

- These rules apply to ALL AI agents, regardless of capabilities
- No agent may grant itself additional git permissions
- User must explicitly run git commands themselves for non-workflow operations
- Workflow files in `.claude/commands/` are the source of truth for exceptions

## Additional Universal Restrictions

### File System Safety

- NO modifying system files outside the project directory
- NO creating backup files without explicit permission
- NO modifying configuration files (.env, .config) without approval

### Code Safety

- NO installing or updating dependencies without explicit approval
- NO executing code with side effects (API calls, database modifications) without permission
- NO modifying security-sensitive files without justification
- NO deleting or disabling existing tests without explanation

### Character Encoding and Typography

- **NEVER use emojis** in code, documentation, or any files
- **Use ASCII equivalents** for special characters:
  - Arrows: Use `->` instead of Unicode arrows (→, ←, ↑, ↓)
  - Checkmarks: Use `[x]` instead of ✓ or ✔
  - Crosses: Use `[ ]` or `[X]` instead of ✗ or ✘
  - Box drawing: Use ASCII art (`+--`, `|`, etc.) instead of Unicode box characters
  - Math symbols: Use ASCII (`<=`, `>=`, `!=`, `^2`) instead of Unicode (≤, ≥, ≠, ²)
- **ALLOWED exceptions when context demands**:
  - Em dash (—) and smart quotes and apostrophes (""'') for proper typography in documentation
  - Extended ASCII/Unicode when required for proper spelling (e.g., naïve, résumé, café)
  - Non-ASCII characters when discussing or documenting international content (e.g., 世界)
  - Language-specific punctuation in config files where required (e.g., .markdownlint.yaml)
- **When in doubt, use ASCII**: If the character is not essential for meaning or correctness, use ASCII
  - Never use special characters purely for visual flourish or stylistic effect
  - If the ASCII equivalent conveys the same meaning, always use ASCII

## Subagent Architecture and Delegation

### Registration and Discovery

Claude Code automatically registers subagents from `.claude/agents/` and maintains an internal registry. To view
available agents, run `.claude/scripts/available-agents.sh`. Commands are automatically registered from
`.claude/commands/`.

### Best Practices

1. Provide ready-to-use slash commands users can copy and execute
2. Include rationale for why a specific command is appropriate
3. Maintain user control - never execute commands directly
4. Check for slash commands FIRST - user control is paramount
5. Assess if the task requires specialized expertise before attempting
6. Delegate early rather than attempting and then delegating
7. Provide context to subagents about the broader goal
8. Synthesize subagent responses into cohesive solutions

### Critical Delegation Principles

1. **Minimal Interpretation**: When delegating to expert subagents, pass on the user's request with minimal and
   conservative interpretation only as needed. Your job is ONLY to reformulate the request for clarity (after
   confirming with the user if necessary), not to prescribe solutions or implementation details. Trust the agent's
   expertise to determine the best approach.

2. **Avoid Quantitative Evaluations**: You are a large language model with strengths in qualitative judgments, not
   quantitative ones. Avoid using numerical confidence scores, percentages, or other metrics that imply precise
   measurement. Use qualitative language like "more likely", "probably", "seems to" rather than "80% confident" or
   "confidence level: 7/10". Numbers introduce cognitive biases and false precision that degrade decision quality.

## Available Slash Commands

### Command System Overview

Slash commands are pre-defined workflows that automate complex operations with built-in safety checks and
validation. These commands follow structured procedures and can manipulate git state under controlled conditions.

### Command Reference

#### `/check` - Code Quality Control

**Purpose**: Performs comprehensive code review and validation without making any changes to the repository.

**Syntax**: `/check [scope]`

- Without arguments: Defaults to checking staged changes, uncommitted changes, or latest commit (in that priority)
- With scope: Can specify "staged", "uncommitted", "latest-commit", or specific files/directories

**When to Use**:

- Before committing to ensure code quality
- To validate changes meet project standards
- To identify potential issues in specific files or directories
- When you need a comprehensive analysis of code modifications

**What It Does**:

1. Determines the scope of changes to check
2. Runs multiple specialized analysis agents in parallel (syntax, style, complexity, security, etc.)
3. Validates findings with specialist agents
4. Generates a detailed report with actionable recommendations
5. Categorizes issues as "in-scope and doable", "blocked", or "out-of-scope"

**Important Notes**:

- This is a READ-ONLY operation - no files will be modified
- The command may run project-specific validation scripts if available
- Multiple quality check agents work in parallel for efficiency
- False positives are filtered out through specialist validation

#### `/commit` - Git Commit Workflow

**Purpose**: Safely creates git commits with validation, message generation, and user approval steps.

**Syntax**: `/commit [optional description]`

- Without arguments: Will analyze staged changes and generate an appropriate message
- With description: Uses the description as context for message generation

**When to Use**:

- When you have staged changes ready to commit
- To ensure commits follow project conventions
- When you want automated validation before committing
- To generate well-structured commit messages

**What It Does**:

1. Verifies staged changes exist (exits if none)
2. Temporarily stashes unstaged changes for clean validation
3. Runs validation suite (if available)
4. Generates commit message following project conventions
5. Presents changes and message for user approval
6. Creates commit upon approval
7. Restores unstaged changes

**Important Notes**:

- **Will auto-stage changes** based on description (coming soon - currently requires pre-staged changes)
- Validation failures block the commit unless explicitly overridden
- Interactive approval loop allows message refinement
- Preserves both staged and unstaged changes throughout the process
- Never adds automated signatures or co-author tags unless explicitly approved
- Uses location-based prefixes in commit messages (e.g., 'parser:', 'auth:'), not type prefixes

### Command Availability and Restrictions

#### Git State Modification

- Only `/commit` has permission to modify git state (create commits)
- `/check` remains strictly read-only
- Both commands respect the project's git safety protocols
- User approval is required at critical decision points

#### Error Handling

- Commands will fail safely, preserving all work
- Clear error messages explain what went wrong
- Recovery suggestions are provided when operations fail
- Stashed changes are always restored even if operations fail

#### When Commands Are Not Available

If a slash command doesn't exist for a requested operation:

1. The AI agent will explain the restriction
2. Suggest manual commands the user can run
3. Provide guidance on safe execution practices

### Best Practices for AI Agents

When recommending slash commands:

1. **Provide ready-to-use commands** - Give exact command syntax the user can copy and execute
2. **Match user intent to available commands** - If a user wants to commit, suggest `/commit` with appropriate
   description
3. **Explain what the command will do** - Set clear expectations about the workflow steps
4. **Include rationale** - Explain why this command is appropriate for their request
5. **Note any prerequisites** - For `/commit`, mention that changes must be staged first
6. **Maintain user control** - Never execute workflows directly, always let users run the commands
7. **Offer alternatives when commands don't exist** - Provide manual git commands with safety warnings
8. **Never modify command behavior** - Follow the documented workflows exactly

**These rules are non-negotiable and apply to all AI agent interactions within this repository.**
