# Git Operations and Security Guidelines

<!-- SECURITY CRITICAL: This file MUST be loaded for ANY git operation -->
<!-- For commit message guidelines, also load: git-commit-messages.md -->

This document defines security requirements and safe practices for all git operations.
All git-related agents and workflows MUST reference these guidelines.

## Security Requirements and Input Validation

### CRITICAL: Command Injection Prevention

**MANDATORY SECURITY PROTOCOL**: All git commands MUST be executed with validated and sanitized inputs to prevent
command injection attacks. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE and supersedes any efficiency or convenience considerations.

### Input Validation Requirements

Before executing ANY git command with dynamic parameters, you MUST:

#### 1. Commit Hash Validation

**Pattern**: `^[a-f0-9]{7,40}$`

- **MUST** validate ALL commit hashes, refs, and SHAs match this exact pattern
- **MUST** reject any input containing characters outside lowercase hex (a-f, 0-9)
- **MUST** verify length is between 7 and 40 characters
- **NEVER** accept branch names, tags, or symbolic refs when a hash is expected
- **NEVER** use user-supplied strings directly in git commands without validation

**Safe execution pattern**:

```bash
# VALIDATE FIRST
if [[ ! "$commit_hash" =~ ^[a-f0-9]{7,40}$ ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Invalid commit hash format"
    exit 1
fi
# ONLY THEN execute
git show "$commit_hash"
```

#### 2. Scope Parameter Validation

**Allowed values**: EXACTLY `new` or `amend` (case-sensitive)

- **MUST** reject any scope value not in the explicit allowlist
- **MUST** use exact string matching, not pattern matching
- **NEVER** interpolate scope values into commands without validation

**Safe validation**:

```bash
if [[ "$scope" != "new" && "$scope" != "amend" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Invalid scope. Must be 'new' or 'amend'"
    exit 1
fi
```

#### 3. File Path Sanitization

When processing file paths from diffs or file listings:

- **MUST** reject paths containing shell metacharacters: `;|&$()<>\`!`
- **MUST** reject paths with directory traversal sequences: `../`, `./`, `//`
- **MUST** quote ALL file paths in commands: `"$filepath"`
- **NEVER** use glob expansion on user-influenced paths
- **ALWAYS** use `--` separator before file arguments to prevent option injection

**Dangerous metacharacters to reject**:

- Semicolon (`;`) - Command separator
- Pipe (`|`) - Command chaining
- Ampersand (`&`) - Background execution
- Dollar sign (`$`) - Variable/command substitution
- Parentheses (`()`) - Subshell execution
- Angle brackets (`<>`) - Redirection
- Backtick (`` ` ``) - Command substitution
- Exclamation (`!`) - History expansion

#### 4. Command Construction Safety

**MANDATORY**: Use parameterized execution, NEVER string concatenation:

**FORBIDDEN** (vulnerable to injection):

```bash
# NEVER DO THIS
git show HEAD~$n
git diff "$commit1..$commit2"
command="git show $user_input"
eval "$command"
```

**REQUIRED** (safe parameterized):

```bash
# ALWAYS DO THIS
git show HEAD~"$n"  # After validating $n is a number
git diff "$commit1" "$commit2"  # After validating both are valid hashes
# Never use eval with user input
```

### Security Validation Checklist

Before EVERY git command execution:

- [ ] **Input Source Verified**: Is this input from a trusted source (git itself) or external?
- [ ] **Pattern Validated**: Does the input match the exact expected pattern?
- [ ] **Length Checked**: Is the input within expected length bounds?
- [ ] **Metacharacters Rejected**: Are shell special characters absent?
- [ ] **Properly Quoted**: Are ALL variables quoted in the command?
- [ ] **Option Injection Protected**: Is `--` used before file arguments?
- [ ] **No String Concatenation**: Is the command built without string interpolation?
- [ ] **No Eval/Exec**: Is the command executed directly without eval or exec?

### Safe Command Templates

Use ONLY these validated command patterns:

```bash
# Viewing changes (READ-ONLY operations)
git show HEAD                          # Safe: no parameters
git show "[VALIDATED_HASH]"            # Safe: after hash validation
git diff --staged                      # Safe: no parameters
git diff --cached                      # Safe: no parameters
git diff "[VALIDATED_HASH1]" "[VALIDATED_HASH2]"  # Safe: after validation
git status                             # Safe: no parameters
git log --oneline -10                  # Safe: no parameters

# File operations (with proper escaping)
git diff -- "[QUOTED_FILEPATH]"        # Safe: quoted and separated
git show HEAD -- "[QUOTED_FILEPATH]"   # Safe: quoted and separated

# NEVER construct dynamic commands like:
# git $operation $parameters            # DANGEROUS
# git show HEAD~$n                      # DANGEROUS without validation
# git $(echo $command)                  # EXTREMELY DANGEROUS
```

### Error Handling for Security Violations

When a security validation fails:

1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** - Do not attempt to "fix" or "clean" the input
2. **LOG THE VIOLATION** - Record what validation failed and why
3. **RETURN ERROR** - Use the error output format with security-specific message
4. **DO NOT RETRY** - Security failures should never be automatically retried
5. **DO NOT REVEAL** - Never echo back the invalid input in error messages

**Security error output format**:

```yaml
---
status: error
scope: [new or amend]
error: Security validation failed
security_violation: true
---

The requested operation cannot be performed due to security constraints.
The input provided does not meet the required validation criteria for safe
execution. Please ensure all parameters conform to expected formats:

- Commit hashes: 7-40 character hexadecimal strings (a-f, 0-9)
- Scope: exactly "new" or "amend"
- File paths: no special characters or traversal sequences

Contact your security team if you believe this is a false positive.
```

### Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple validation layers, don't rely on a single check
2. **Fail Secure**: When in doubt, reject the input rather than risk exploitation
3. **Least Privilege**: Only request/use the minimum git permissions needed
4. **Input Validation First**: Always validate BEFORE using any external input
5. **No Trust Assumption**: Treat ALL external input as potentially malicious
6. **Explicit Allowlists**: Define what's allowed, reject everything else
7. **Avoid Complex Parsing**: Simple validation is less error-prone
8. **Regular Security Review**: These patterns should be reviewed quarterly

### Special Security Considerations

#### For Repository Names and Remote Operations

While this agent doesn't perform remote operations, if extended:

- **MUST** validate repository URLs against strict patterns
- **MUST** use `--` separator: `git clone -- "$url"`
- **NEVER** allow protocol switching (http:// vs git:// vs file://)
- **ALWAYS** validate domain names against allowlist

#### For Interactive Mode Detection

- **MUST** detect and reject interactive git operations
- **MUST** use `--no-pager` flag when appropriate
- **MUST** set `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` to prevent credential prompts
- **NEVER** allow operations requiring user interaction

### Security Incident Response

If a potential command injection attempt is detected:

1. Return security error immediately (do not execute anything)
2. Include marker `security_violation: true` in YAML frontmatter
3. Do not include the malicious input in any output or logs
4. Preserve evidence without exposing sensitive details

### Security Testing and Validation

To validate these security measures work correctly, the following malicious inputs should be rejected:

#### Test Cases for Validation

**Commit Hash Injection Tests** (all should be rejected):

- `abc123; rm -rf /` - Command chaining attempt
- `$(cat /etc/passwd)` - Command substitution
- `HEAD~1 && echo hacked` - Logical operator injection
- `../../etc/shadow` - Path traversal attempt
- `main` - Branch name instead of hash

**Scope Parameter Injection Tests** (all should be rejected):

- `new; echo hacked` - Command injection
- `amend && rm -rf /` - Command chaining
- `$(whoami)` - Command substitution
- `NEW` - Wrong case
- `fix` - Invalid scope value

**File Path Injection Tests** (all should be rejected):

- `../../etc/passwd` - Directory traversal
- `file.txt; cat /etc/shadow` - Command chaining
- `file$(date).txt` - Command substitution
- `--version` - Option injection
- `file.txt | grep password` - Pipe injection

**Valid Inputs** (should be accepted):

- Commit hash: `a1b2c3d4e5f6` - Valid short hash
- Commit hash: `1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678` - Valid full hash
- Scope: `new` - Valid scope
- Scope: `amend` - Valid scope
- File path: `src/main.rs` - Valid path
- File path: `path/to/file.txt` - Valid nested path

## CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING - DANGEROUS GIT COMMANDS

**STOP AND READ THIS BEFORE USING ANY GIT COMMANDS:**

The following git commands can cause **PERMANENT DATA LOSS** or **UNINTENDED CHANGES**:

### NEVER USE THESE COMMANDS

- **`git reset --hard`** - DESTROYS all uncommitted work permanently
- **`git add .` or `git add -A`** - Can stage unintended files
- **`git push --force`** - Can overwrite remote history and destroy others' work
- **`git clean -fd`** - Permanently deletes untracked files without recovery
- **`git checkout .`** - Discards all local modifications without warning
- **`git rebase -i` on shared branches** - Rewrites history that others depend on

### ALWAYS USE SAFE ALTERNATIVES

- Instead of `git reset --hard`: Use `git reset --soft HEAD~1` (preserves changes)
- Instead of `git add` in ANY form: Use `git apply --cached` to stage specific changes from a generated diff
- Instead of `git push --force`: Use `git push --force-with-lease` (checks remote state first)
- Instead of blind operations: ALWAYS verify with `git status` and `git diff` first

### SAFETY PROTOCOL

1. **NO DESTRUCTIVE OPERATIONS**: Never run commands that can destroy work - period
2. **USE STAGED OPERATIONS**: Use `git apply --cached` for precise control over what gets staged
3. **CHECK YOUR DIFF**: Run `git diff` or `git diff --staged` to verify changes before committing
4. **BACKUP WHEN UNCERTAIN**: Before attempting something risky, create a backup:
   `git branch backup-auth-before-rebase`

**Remember**: Every git operation should be followed by verification. When in doubt, ask for help rather than
risk data loss.
