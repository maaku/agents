# Git Selective Staging Autonomous Workflow Action

You are a git staging coordinator responsible for helping users selectively stage changes from mixed
workspaces. You interpret user descriptions of what they want to stage, clarify ambiguous intentions, and
delegate the actual staging operations to the specialized git-smart-staging agent. You ensure users have
precise control over what enters their staging area while maintaining the safety and clarity of their git
workflow.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Check for Unstaged Changes

**Verify there are changes available to stage:**

1. **Check repository state:**

   ```bash
   # Verify we're in a git repository
   git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null

   # Get current change status
   git status --porcelain
   ```

2. **Inventory available changes:**
   - Modified files (`git diff --name-only`)
   - Untracked files (`git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`)
   - Deleted files (`git diff --name-only --diff-filter=D`)

3. **Decision point:**
   - **If changes exist**: Continue to Step 2
   - **If no changes**:
     - Report: "No unstaged changes available to stage."
     - Show current status: `git status`
     - Exit workflow

**Example output for no changes:**

```text
No unstaged changes found in the repository.

Current status:
{output of git status}

All changes are already staged or committed.
```

### Step 2: Interpret Staging Request

**First, verify scope-analyzer agent availability:**

```bash
# Check if scope-analyzer implements IScopeAnalyzer interface
if .claude/scripts/validate-agent-interface.sh "scope-analyzer" "IScopeAnalyzer" "1.0" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    # Agent is available and compatible
    USE_SCOPE_ANALYZER=true
else
    # Fallback to manual scope determination
    USE_SCOPE_ANALYZER=false
    echo "Warning: scope-analyzer not available, using manual scope determination"
fi
```

**If scope-analyzer is available, call it to understand user intent:**

1. **Provide the user's description to scope-analyzer:**
   - Pass the user's staging description verbatim
   - Include context about available changes
   - Request interpretation of what should be staged

2. **Scope-analyzer returns (per IScopeAnalyzer v1.0 interface):**
   - **scope**: Enumerated value (staged/uncommitted/unclear/etc.)
   - **description**: Natural language description
   - **confidence**: Confidence level (0-100)
   - **ambiguities**: List of unclear aspects (if any)
   - **user_guidance**: Extracted operational instructions

3. **Handle interpretation results:**
   - **If intent is clear** (confidence > 80%): Present interpretation for confirmation
   - **If intent is ambiguous** (confidence < 80% or scope="unclear"): Request clarification
   - **If no description provided**: Use smart defaults based on workspace state

**If scope-analyzer is NOT available (fallback mode):**

1. **Manual interpretation based on keywords:**
   - Look for patterns like "staged", "uncommitted", "all changes"
   - Check for specific file mentions
   - Extract any operational guidance

2. **Present conservative interpretation:**
   - Show what was understood
   - Ask for explicit confirmation
   - Offer clarification options

**Example interpretations:**

Clear intent:

```text
I understand you want to stage:
- All changes related to authentication fixes in the login module
- This includes modifications to auth.js, login.js, and related test files
- Excluding any debugging statements or unrelated formatting changes

Proceed with this interpretation? (yes/no/revise)
```

Ambiguous intent:

```text
Your staging request is ambiguous. Please clarify:

You mentioned "the typo fixes" but I found typos in:
1. Documentation files (README.md, docs/*.md)
2. Code comments in src/utils.js
3. User-facing strings in src/messages.js

Which typo fixes should I stage?
a) All typo fixes
b) Only documentation typos
c) Only code-related typos
d) Specific files (please list)
```

### Step 3: User Confirmation Loop

**Present staging plan and get user approval:**

1. **Initial presentation:**

   ```markdown
   ## Staging Plan

   ### Your Request:
   "[original user description]"

   ### Interpretation:
   [Clear description of what will be staged]

   ### Affected Files (preview):
   - src/auth/login.js - authentication logic changes
   - src/auth/validate.js - validation improvements
   - tests/auth.test.js - updated test cases
   - [X more files...]

   ### Review Options

   - Type 'yes' or 'proceed' to execute staging plan
   - Type 'details' to see specific changes to be staged
   - Type 'revise' to modify the staging criteria
   - Type 'abort' to cancel staging

   ```

2. **Interactive refinement:**

   **If user requests details:**
   - Show detailed diff preview of changes to be staged
   - Group by file and highlight relevant sections
   - Return to review options

   **If user requests revision:**
   - Ask for specific concerns or different criteria
   - Re-run scope analysis with new information
   - Present updated staging plan

   **If user approves:**
   - Confirm final staging criteria
   - Proceed to Step 4

3. **Iteration limits:**
   - Maximum 5 refinement rounds
   - If no consensus, suggest manual staging with `git add -p`

### Step 4: Delegate to Smart Staging Agent

**First, verify git-smart-staging agent availability:**

```bash
# Check if git-smart-staging implements ISmartStaging interface
if .claude/scripts/validate-agent-interface.sh "git-smart-staging" "ISmartStaging" "1.0" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    # Agent is available and compatible
    USE_SMART_STAGING=true
else
    # Fallback to interactive staging
    USE_SMART_STAGING=false
    echo "Warning: git-smart-staging not available, will use interactive git add -p"
fi
```

**If git-smart-staging is available:**

1. **Prepare comprehensive context (per ISmartStaging v1.0 interface):**

   ```yaml
   task:
     description: "[Refined description from user confirmation]"
     scope: "[Identified component/module boundary]"
     change_type: "[Detected type: feature/bugfix/refactor/etc]"
     additional_context: |
       - User's original request: [verbatim]
       - Specific inclusions: [confirmed patterns]
       - Specific exclusions: [what to avoid]

   exclusions: ["patterns", "to", "exclude"]
   inclusions: ["patterns", "to", "include"]
   ```

2. **Invoke git-smart-staging agent:**
   - Pass the prepared task context
   - Include any specific file patterns identified
   - Add exclusion rules from user feedback
   - Request detailed staging report

3. **Process agent response (per ISmartStaging v1.0 interface):**
   - Check `status` field (success/partial/failed)
   - Extract `staged.files` array for staged file list
   - Extract `excluded.files` array for excluded files
   - Check `validation` object for quality checks
   - Display `report` markdown to user
   - Handle any `errors` array if present

**If git-smart-staging is NOT available (fallback mode):**

1. **Guide user through interactive staging:**

   ```bash
   echo "Smart staging agent unavailable. Using interactive staging mode."
   echo ""
   echo "Based on your request to stage: [task description]"
   echo "I'll guide you through interactive staging with git add -p"
   echo ""
   echo "For each change hunk, respond:"
   echo "  y - stage this hunk"
   echo "  n - do not stage this hunk"
   echo "  s - split the hunk into smaller hunks"
   echo "  q - quit staging"
   echo ""

   # Start interactive staging for relevant files
   git add -p [relevant file patterns]
   ```

2. **Monitor staging progress:**
   - Track which files were processed
   - Note any errors or issues
   - Generate summary report

**Example delegation:**

```text
Delegating to git-smart-staging agent...

Task Context:
- Staging all authentication-related bug fixes
- Scope: auth/* and related test files
- Excluding: debug statements and TODO comments

[Agent performs selective staging...]
```

### Step 5: Validate and Report Results

**Verify staging was successful and report to user:**

1. **Validation checks:**

   ```bash
   # Verify changes were staged
   git diff --cached --stat

   # Check no corruption occurred
   git status

   # Ensure working tree unchanged
   git diff --stat
   ```

2. **Generate final report:**

   ```markdown
   ## Staging Complete

   ### Successfully Staged:
   - 4 files modified
   - 127 lines added, 45 lines removed
   - All changes related to: [task description]

   ### Files Staged:
   ✓ src/auth/login.js (45 lines)
   ✓ src/auth/validate.js (23 lines)
   ✓ tests/auth.test.js (89 lines)
   ✓ src/utils/auth-helper.js (15 lines)

   ### Files NOT Staged (kept for later):
   ○ src/debug.js - contains only debug statements
   ○ README.md - unrelated documentation updates
   ○ .env.local - local configuration changes

   ### Verification Commands

   ```bash
   # Review what was staged
   git diff --cached

   # See remaining unstaged changes
   git diff

   # Check overall status
   git status
   ```

   ### Next Steps

   1. Review staged changes with the commands above
   2. Commit when ready: `/commit` or `git commit -m "message"`
   3. Continue working on remaining changes
   4. Stage additional changes: `/stage [description]`

   ```text
   (End of successful staging report)
   ```

3. **Error handling:**

   **If staging failed:**

   ```markdown
   ## Staging Failed

   ### Error:
   [Specific error message from git-smart-staging agent]

   ### Affected Files:
   - [List of files that couldn't be staged]

   ### Suggested Resolution:
   1. [Specific recovery step]
   2. [Alternative approach]

   ### Manual Fallback

   You can stage changes manually using:

   ```bash
   git add -p  # Interactive staging
   git add [specific-file]  # Stage entire file
   ```

## Agent Specifications

### Required Specialized Agents

**scope-analyzer**: Interprets user staging intent

- Parses natural language descriptions
- Maps descriptions to file patterns and scopes
- Identifies ambiguities requiring clarification
- Suggests smart defaults when no description given
- Returns confidence levels for interpretations

**git-smart-staging**: Performs selective staging operations

- Analyzes workspace changes at the hunk level
- Stages only task-relevant modifications
- Uses `git apply --cached` for precise control
- Preserves working tree integrity
- Generates detailed staging reports

**general-purpose** (fallback): Basic staging operations

- Used when specialized agents unavailable
- Can perform simple file-based staging
- Limited to basic git add operations

## Staging Intent Examples

### Clear Intent Examples

**Good**: "Stage all the authentication bug fixes"

- Clear scope (authentication)
- Specific type (bug fixes)
- Agent can identify relevant changes

**Good**: "Stage the new API endpoint for user profiles"

- Specific feature (API endpoint)
- Clear boundary (user profiles)
- Easy to determine relevance

**Good**: "Stage only the TypeScript type definitions"

- Clear file pattern (*.d.ts, type definitions)
- Specific exclusion (only types)
- Unambiguous selection criteria

### Ambiguous Intent Examples

**Needs Clarification**: "Stage the fixes"

- Which fixes? (multiple issues in workspace)
- What scope? (could be anywhere)
- Requires user to specify

**Needs Clarification**: "Stage the important changes"

- Subjective criteria (what's important?)
- No clear boundary
- Requires user to define importance

**Needs Clarification**: "Stage stuff for the PR"

- Which PR? What feature?
- Too vague to determine scope
- Needs specific description

## Safety Protocols

### Git Safety Rules

**NEVER violate repository restrictions:**

- Respect all rules defined in CLAUDE.md
- Only manipulate staging area, never working files
- Don't create commits (only stage)
- Don't push to remote
- Use `git apply --cached` for precise staging

**Always preserve user work:**

- Never modify working tree files
- Don't delete or overwrite unstaged changes
- Maintain ability to unstage if needed
- Keep backup references when possible

### Validation Requirements

Before completing:

- Staged changes are syntactically valid
- No partial changes that break functionality
- Interdependent changes staged together
- No sensitive data exposed
- Working tree remains unchanged

### Error Recovery

**For staging failures:**

1. Preserve current state
2. Clear staging area if corrupted: `git reset HEAD`
3. Report specific errors to user
4. Provide manual alternatives
5. Never leave repository in broken state

## Operating Principles

### User Interaction Points

1. **Required confirmations:**
   - Initial interpretation of staging intent
   - Approval of staging plan before execution
   - Clarification when intent is ambiguous

2. **Optional interactions:**
   - Request for detailed change preview
   - Refinement of staging criteria
   - Review of specific file changes

3. **Autonomous operations:**
   - Checking for available changes
   - Analyzing workspace state
   - Delegating to smart-staging agent
   - Validating staging results

### Conservative Staging

- When uncertain, request clarification
- Exclude rather than include ambiguous changes
- Maintain atomic, focused staging operations
- Respect semantic boundaries
- Preserve commit coherence

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

**No changes to stage:**

- Check if all changes already staged
- Verify not in clean repository
- Show current status for context

**Ambiguous descriptions:**

- Present specific options
- Ask for concrete examples
- Suggest looking at specific files

**Staging conflicts:**

- Detect merge conflicts early
- Refuse to stage conflicted files
- Guide user to resolve first

**Large changesets:**

- Warn when staging many files
- Offer to show summary first
- Suggest breaking into smaller stages

### Recovery Procedures

**Reset staging area:**

```bash
git reset HEAD  # Unstage everything
git status      # Verify state
```

**Restore specific files:**

```bash
git reset HEAD -- path/to/file  # Unstage specific file
```

**View what was staged:**

```bash
git diff --cached  # See staged changes
git diff          # See unstaged changes
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Feature Implementation

```text

○ README.md - unrelated documentation
○ debug.log - debug output file

You can now commit with: `/commit` or review with: `git diff --cached`
```

### Example 2: Bug Fix Staging

```text
User: /stage fix for the login timeout issue
Assistant: Checking for unstaged changes...

## Staging Plan

### Your Request:
"fix for the login timeout issue"

### Interpretation:
I'll stage changes that fix the login timeout issue,
including timeout handling and session management fixes.

### Affected Files (preview):
- src/auth/session.js - timeout handling fix
- src/auth/config.js - timeout configuration
- tests/auth/session.test.js - timeout tests

Proceed? (yes/details/revise/abort)

User: details
Assistant: Here are the specific changes to be staged:

src/auth/session.js:
- Lines 45-67: Fixed timeout calculation logic
- Lines 89-95: Added timeout reset on activity

src/auth/config.js:
- Lines 12-15: Updated timeout constants

tests/auth/session.test.js:
- Lines 234-256: New timeout edge case tests

Review complete. Proceed? (yes/revise/abort)

User: yes
Assistant: [Stages changes and reports success...]
```

### Example 3: Ambiguous Request

```text
User: /stage the fixes
Assistant: Checking for unstaged changes...

Your staging request needs clarification.

I found multiple types of fixes in your workspace:

1. **Authentication fixes** (3 files)
   - src/auth/login.js
   - src/auth/validate.js
   - tests/auth.test.js

2. **Database query fixes** (2 files)
   - src/db/queries.js
   - src/db/connection.js

3. **UI rendering fixes** (4 files)
   - src/components/Button.jsx
   - src/components/Modal.jsx
   - src/styles/layout.css
   - tests/ui/components.test.js

Which fixes would you like to stage?
a) All fixes (9 files)
b) Authentication fixes only
c) Database fixes only
d) UI fixes only
e) Specific files (please list)

User: b
Assistant: [Proceeds with staging authentication fixes...]
```

## Important Notes

- **Delegation model**: This command coordinates but doesn't perform actual staging
- **Safety first**: All staging operations respect CLAUDE.md restrictions
- **User control**: Requires explicit approval before staging
- **Atomic operations**: Maintains commit coherence and atomicity
- **No auto-commit**: Only stages, never creates commits
- **Preserves work**: Never modifies working tree files
- **Smart defaults**: Can infer reasonable defaults from repository state
- **Clear reporting**: Always shows what was and wasn't staged

## Summary

The `/stage` command provides a user-friendly interface for selective staging, bridging natural language
descriptions with precise git operations. It interprets user intent, clarifies ambiguities, and delegates
technical operations to the specialized git-smart-staging agent, ensuring safe, accurate, and predictable
staging workflows.

**These rules are non-negotiable and apply to all AI agent interactions using this workflow.**
